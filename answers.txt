What is a remote repository?
    The remote repository is a central online repository that is seen 
    by several collaborators. The remote repository has a history just
    like the local repository

What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
    A merge is non-destructive and preserves the history of the repository
    while a rebase moves the feature branch onto the tip of the main branch
    creating a more linear history.
